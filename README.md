<!-- RATIONALE -->
## Rationale

This being a small project, I have tried to limit the number of libraries. As such, I haven't included any state management library.

I have also not included a component library as there was no need for that.

I would have loved to add more tests to the project but time hasn't been on my side. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me in case you need more information on testing.
